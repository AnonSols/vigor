 
## Rabahh Hotel Management Application

This is a **fully functional** hotel management application built using modern tools like **React TypeScript** for its development, **Context API** for state management, **React Query** for remote state management, and **Supabase** for the backend. 

The application is designed to assist hotel employees with managing user check-ins and check-outs, providing a detailed dashboard to track bookings, sales, and occupancy rates.

### Features of Version 1:
- **Dashboard**: 
  - View overall sales, bookings, and occupancy rate with interactive charts (e.g., pie charts for night stays).
  - Track today's activities like guest check-ins and check-outs.
  - Duration charts showing how long guests stay.
- **Booking Management**: 
  - Add, edit, or delete guest bookings.
  - Check guests in or out.
  - View detailed guest information.
- **Room Management**: 
  - Add, edit, or delete hotel rooms.

- **Settings Section**: 
  - Configure hotel preferences.
- **Light/Dark Mode**:

- **Live Chat**: 
  - Customer support feature for hotel employees.
  
### Version 2 (Planned Updates):
- Enable adding new guests directly (without sample data).
- Bookings can be edited, including check-in and check-out times.
- Dynamic room pricing (daily).
- **Restaurant Section**: 
  - Add restaurant charges to guest bills.
- PDF invoice generation and email at checkout.

### Version 3 (Future Plans):
